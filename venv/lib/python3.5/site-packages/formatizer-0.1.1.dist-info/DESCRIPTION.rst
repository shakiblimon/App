Formatizer provides literal string formatting for Python versions older
than 3.6. This replaces the need for substitution using ``%`` or the
``format`` function.

Formatizer is covered by unit tests and Flake8 compliance. Please note
that this library does use ``eval`` to perform its expression
processing.

Quick Start
-----------

Install Formatizer in your virtualenv as follows:

.. code:: bash

    pip install formatizer

And now, go ahead and use the f function similarly to `PEP
498 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/>`__:

.. code:: python

    from __future__ import print_function
    from formatizer import f

    GREETING = 'hi'

    def main():
        name = 'Fotis'
        print(f('My name is {name}, I say {GREETING} and 1 + 2 is {1 + 2}'))

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

All local and global variables will be recognised by the ``f`` function
and complete Python expressions are also allowed between the braces much
like Python 3.6.
